# PS5 RetroArch - build the title.
#
#   tools/build-title.sh            compile the frontend, then link and sign it
#   tools/build-title.sh --stage    also copy the result to handoff/<TITLE_ID>/
#
# The whole build is three steps that depend on each other in one direction:
#
#   1. tools/build-retroarch.sh   compiles RetroArch's own sources into
#                                 build/ra/libretroarch.a
#   2. make app                   compiles src/, links that archive with the
#                                 pipeline's CRT, signs the result and assembles
#                                 the title folder under dist/<TITLE_ID>/
#   3. handoff                    a copy of that folder for the console's owner
#
# Step 2 is the project's own Makefile, not a reimplementation of it. What this
# script adds is the four things the Makefile cannot know, each of which was found
# by a failed build and is why the environment is set here rather than typed:
#
#   PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK   this project's vendored SDK, not the one in $HOME and not a
#                     sibling's: the wrapper's default and the donor's differ
#   PS5_CLANG         the toolchain's wrapper defaults to clang-18, which is not
#                     installed; plain clang is what this machine builds with
#   PYTHONPATH        mbedTLS regenerates a source file by running a script that
#                     imports jsonschema; tooling/pystub supplies it
#   APP_INCLUDE_PATHS src/ includes RetroArch's headers, and those come from the
#                     configured copy under build/ so the driver is declared
#   APP_STATIC_ARCHIVES the frontend archive from step 1
#
# Signing happens inside step 2 and is not optional: the console loads a fake
# self, not an ELF, and an unsigned eboot.bin is a title that fails to start with
# no message of its own.

# The title's own sources are compiled with the same feature defines as the
# frontend, because the two share a header full of #ifdefs and a struct whose
# member order those #ifdefs decide. This is not a nicety; it was a bug with no
# symptom except a menu that never appeared. Compiled without these, src/'s copy of
# RetroArch's headers had HAVE_OVERLAY and HAVE_GFX_WIDGETS off, so video_ps5 - the
# driver table this project hands the frontend - was laid out 8 bytes shorter than
# the frontend's own view of the same struct. Everything the frontend reads after
# overlay_interface was therefore the member before it: poke_interface and
# wrap_type_to_enum both read as NULL. The driver still opened the display and
# presented 1500 frames, alive() was still the right function by luck, and the only
# consequence was that RGUI - which renders the menu into its own 320x240
# framebuffer and hands it over through poke->set_texture_frame - had nowhere to
# hand it. The frontend calls poke_interface only when it is not NULL, so the
# hand-over died in silence.
